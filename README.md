# 👥 HR Insights & Attrition Trends Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing **employee attrition trends** and workforce insights using **Power BI**. By leveraging interactive dashboards, the goal is to help organizations understand the key drivers of attrition and develop strategies to improve employee retention.  

---

## 🏦 Problem Statement
Employee attrition significantly impacts organizational stability and costs. HR teams need data-driven insights into:
- Which departments, job roles, and demographics face the highest attrition  
- How factors like salary, education, and years of service affect attrition  
- Where to focus retention strategies to minimize workforce loss  

---

## 🛠️ ETL Workflow
The dataset was processed and cleaned before visualization in Power BI:  
- **Extract:** HR dataset loaded into Power BI Desktop  
- **Transform:**  
  - Removed inconsistencies and duplicates  
  - Categorized salary slabs (Upto 5k, 5k–10k, 10k–15k, 15k+)  
  - Grouped employees by age ranges and years of service  
  - Standardized job roles and education fields  
- **Load:** Processed dataset integrated into Power BI dashboards  

---

## 📈 Key Metrics
- **Total Employees:** 1,416  
- **Attrition Count:** 229  
- **Attrition Rate:** 16.2%  
- **Average Age:** 37 years  
- **Average Salary:** $6.5K  
- **Average Years at Company:** 7.0

## 📊 Dashboards & Visuals
1. **Attrition by Education Field** – Highest attrition in Life Sciences (38%) and Medical (25%)  
2. **Attrition by Age Group** – Most attrition in employees aged **26–35**  
3. **Attrition by Salary Slab** – Highest attrition in the lowest salary group (≤ 5k)  
4. **Attrition by Job Role** – Top attrition in Laboratory Technicians, Sales Executives, and Research Scientists  
5. **Attrition by Department & Gender** – HR, R&D, and Sales departments analyzed across male/female employees  
6. **Attrition Over Years of Service** – Significant drop-off within the first 5 years

## ✅ Insights
- Younger employees (26–35) are most likely to leave.  
- Low salary slabs correlate with higher attrition rates.  
- Technical and research-related job roles show notable attrition.  
- Early years of service (0–5 years) are the most critical for retention strategies.  

---

## 🔮 Future Work
- Incorporate **predictive modeling** to forecast attrition risk.  
- Extend dashboards to include **engagement and satisfaction survey data**.  
- Benchmark attrition rates across industries.  
- Develop automated alerts for HR when attrition crosses thresholds.
